Sun Feb  4 13:54:37 PST 2001 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

        Release version 1.03.

Sun Feb  4 11:50:15 PST 2001 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Add a new command line option to timed-process, -e, that takes
	an integer argument.  This value sets the exit value
	timed-process uses for its exit call when it has to kill the
	given program because the timeout elapsed.  This value is not
	used if the process exits before the timeout expires.

	Add tests for for the timed-process script in t/01proc.t.

Sat Feb  3 14:21:32 PST 2001 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Change all occurrences of Proc::Generic, which was the
	original name of this module, with Proc::Background in every
	file in the module.  This includes fixing the timed-process
	script which used Proc::Generic instead of Proc::Background.

Mon Jan 15 16:05:04 PST 2001 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

        Release version 1.02.

Mon Jan 15 10:32:59 PST 2001 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Make Proc::Background::new flexible enough to behave in the
	same manner as exec() or system() do when passed either a
	single or multiple arguments.  When the command to put in the
	background run is passed as an array with two or more
	elements, run the command directly without passing the command
	through the shell.  When a single argument is passed to
	Proc::Background::new, pass the command through the shell.
	Add a new test to the test suite to check a command passed as
	a single argument to Proc::Background::new.

	Remove 'Unrecognized escape \w passed through at Background.pm
	line 30' warning when using Perl 5.6.0.

Wed Jun 21 09:51:37 PDT 2000 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Release version 1.01.

Wed Jun 21 09:47:33 PDT 2000 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Proc::Background::Win32 used to only protect arguments that
	contained he space character by placing "'s around the
	argument.  Now, make sure that each individual argument to
	Proc::Backgrond ends up going to the Windows shell in such a
	way that the shell sees the argument as a single argument.
	This means escaping "'s that are not already escaped and
	placing "'s around the argument if it matches \s.  This will
	protect the string if it finds a \s in it and not just a
	space.

Thu Apr 20 14:46:31 PDT 2000 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Release version 1.00.

Thu Apr 20 14:40:11 PDT 2000 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	In certain circumstances on older Perls, Proc::Background
	would complain that @_ could not be modified since it is a
	read only variable.  Make a copy of @_ and modify that.

Wed Apr 19 19:50:51 PDT 2000 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Release version 0.03.

Wed Apr 19 14:47:58 PDT 2000 <blair@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Relax the requirement that the path to the program has to be
	absolute.  If it is not absolute, then look for the absolute
	location of the program.

	Add a new method named pid that returns the process ID of the
	new process.

Sun Jun 28 12:43:39 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Release version 0.02.

Tue Jun 23 15:13:13 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Restructure the die method.  Keep the OS independent code for
	killing a process in Proc::Background and the OS dependent
	killing code in Proc::Background::*.

	Update the POD for Proc::Background to be more explicit about
	what start_time and end_time return.

	Fix bugs in Proc::Background::Win32.

	Update Makefile.PL to check for Win32::Process installed on
	Win32 systems.

Thu Jun 18 14:52:01 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Update the README to indicate that libwin32 is only needed
	on Win32 systems.

	Remove calls to croak or die.  Call cluck instead.

	Fix the implementation documentation.

	Remove Proc::Background::Win32::alive since
	Proc::Background::alive works.

Thu Apr 24 12:00:00 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Version 0.01
	First version.
