Thu Aug 16 14:36:39 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Release version 1.04.

Thu Aug 16 14:29:14 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* lib/Proc/Background.pm: When new is passed an incorrect
	  number of arguments, do confess using the class passed to
	  new, rather use the hardwired Proc::Background class which
	  will make error messages easier to understand since module
	  complaining about the error will be the correct one.
	* lib/Proc/Background/Unix.pm: Ditto, except for _new, not
	  new.
	* lib/Proc/Background/Win32.pm: Ditto, except for _new, not
	  new.

Thu Aug 16 14:00:41 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* lib/Proc/Background.pm: Proc::Background::new can accept a
	  reference to a hash as its first argument which contains
	  key/value pairs to modify Proc::Background's behavior.
	  Currently the only key understood is `die_upon_destroy'
	  which has the process killed via die() when the
	  Proc::Background object is being DESTROY'ed.
	* t/01proc.t: Add tests to test the new options behavior.

Thu Aug 16 13:30:23 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* lib/Proc/Background.pm: No longer use cluck and return undef
	  to warn about invalid arguments to function calls.  Instead
	  just call confess to print the call stack and quit the
	  script.
	* lib/Proc/Background/Unix.pm: Ditto.
	* lib/Proc/Background/Win32.pm: Ditto.

Tue Aug 14 22:50:14 PDT 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* lib/Proc/Background/Win32.pm: Remove an unnessary loop label
	  in _die.

	  clearer.
	* README: Remove the reference to my FTP site, as it is no
	  longer being used.
	* README: Update all references to Blair Zajac's email
	  addresses to blair@orcaware.com.
	* CHANGES: Ditto.
	* lib/Proc/Background/Unix.pm: Ditto.

Sun Feb  4 13:54:37 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Release version 1.03.

Sun Feb  4 11:50:15 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Add a new command line option to timed-process, -e, that
	  takes an integer argument.  This value sets the exit value
	  timed-process uses for its exit call when it has to kill the
	  given program because the timeout elapsed.  This value is
	  not used if the process exits before the timeout expires.
	* t/01proc.t: Add tests for for the timed-process script.

Sat Feb  3 14:21:32 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Change all occurrences of Proc::Generic, which was the
	  original name of this module, with Proc::Background in every
	  file in the module.  This includes fixing the timed-process
	  script which used Proc::Generic instead of Proc::Background.

Mon Jan 15 16:05:04 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Release version 1.02.

Mon Jan 15 10:32:59 PST 2001 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Make Proc::Background::new flexible enough to behave in the
	  same manner as exec() or system() do when passed either a
	  single or multiple arguments.  When the command to put in
	  the background run is passed as an array with two or more
	  elements, run the command directly without passing the
	  command through the shell.  When a single argument is passed
	  to Proc::Background::new, pass the command through the
	  shell. Add a new test to the test suite to check a command
	  passed as a single argument to Proc::Background::new.
	* Remove 'Unrecognized escape \w passed through at
	  Background.pm line 30' warning when using Perl 5.6.0.

Wed Jun 21 09:51:37 PDT 2000 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Release version 1.01.

Wed Jun 21 09:47:33 PDT 2000 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Proc::Background::Win32 used to only protect arguments that
	  contained he space character by placing "'s around the
	  argument.  Now, make sure that each individual argument to
	  Proc::Backgrond ends up going to the Windows shell in such a
	  way that the shell sees the argument as a single
	  argument. This means escaping "'s that are not already
	  escaped and placing "'s around the argument if it matches
	  \s.  This will protect the string if it finds a \s in it and
	  not just a space.

Thu Apr 20 14:46:31 PDT 2000 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Release version 1.00.

Thu Apr 20 14:40:11 PDT 2000 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* In certain circumstances on older Perls, Proc::Background
	  would complain that @_ could not be modified since it is a
	  read only variable.  Make a copy of @_ and modify that.

Wed Apr 19 19:50:51 PDT 2000 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Release version 0.03.

Wed Apr 19 14:47:58 PDT 2000 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Relax the requirement that the path to the program has to be
	  absolute.  If it is not absolute, then look for the absolute
	  location of the program.

	* Add a new method named pid that returns the process ID of
	  the new process.

Sun Jun 28 12:43:39 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Release version 0.02.

Tue Jun 23 15:13:13 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Restructure the die method.  Keep the OS independent code
	  for killing a process in Proc::Background and the OS
	  dependent killing code in Proc::Background::*.
	* Update the POD for Proc::Background to be more explicit
	  about what start_time and end_time return.
	* Fix bugs in Proc::Background::Win32.
	* Update Makefile.PL to check for Win32::Process installed on
	  Win32 systems.

Thu Jun 18 14:52:01 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Update the README to indicate that libwin32 is only needed
	  on Win32 systems.
	* Remove calls to croak or die.  Call cluck instead.
	* Fix the implementation documentation.
	* Remove Proc::Background::Win32::alive since
	  Proc::Background::alive works.

Thu Apr 24 12:00:00 PDT 1998 <blair@orcaware.com> Blair Zajac

	* Version 0.01
